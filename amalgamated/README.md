This folder contains single header version of mocked CKB syscalls for fuzzing. One thing I learned throughout the years, is that you just cannot force people with different opinions. Some like single header libraries(like I do), some don't. So in this repository we provided 2 options: you can pick the code in [traditional source files and header files](../mock_syscalls), or you can take a single header file in current folder, and be done with it.

Note this file is put in version control as a reference when you don't want to clone and build by yourself. It is built on Ubuntu 24.04 with apt-installed protobuf. If you are using other platforms, chances are need to rebuild the file with a different protobuf version. You can do that via `make flatten`, and just take the generated single header file elsewhere.
